# d.craft

To those unfamiliar — certainly to the parents of players — d.craft may seem like just a Minecraft server. But in the midst of a pandemic, it was an extension of the community at Design Tech High School. A place where students could be themselves and make friends, at a time when both were very difficult. In its time, d.craft became imbued in our school's culture. It was my first foray into bringing both teams and communities together. And by the end of it, I realized, this is what I wanted to do: ship projects people love, and bring people together around them.

Here's the story of how we brought d.craft to life — a virtual recreation of the Design Tech High School campus in Minecraft.

## Culture

I'm very fortunate to have fond memories from my time at [Design Tech High School](https://designtechhighschool.org) ("d.tech" for short). I can only describe d.tech as if it were the brainchild of the [Stanford d.school](https://dschool.stanford.edu) (Hasso Plattner Institute of Design), [IDEO](https://ideo.com), and modern startups.

Well, that's sort of exactly what it is: our founders worked directly with them to figure out what education should look like. The curriculum put heavy emphasis on design thinking and other soft skills that are becoming more and more tangible today. There is a palpable air of experimentation, prototyping, and self-direction. Put simply, if you're anything like me, it is a *dream* of a high school. I loved it very much.

Until January 2018, we occupied a warehouse in Millbrae we lovingly called the "Hangar" (fittingly, it looked like an airplane hangar). "Classrooms" were really sections of the large space separated by makeshift walls made out of wood we cut out. We then moved into Oracle's campus in Redwood Shores, where d.tech now stands.

## Intersession

Four times a year, we'd have Intersession: a two-week break from regular classes to deep dive into guest-led workshops (e.g. productivity & happiness), skills (e.g. Korean martial arts), or self-directed projects.

From May 2019, my incredibly talented friend <Mention name="Joss" avatar="/avatars/joss.jpg" link="https://jossettrick.com" /> and I would lead Intersession cohorts with our friends and build the school, block by block (pun intended).

To be honest, we didn't start out looking to make d.craft as big as it was. It was mainly a joke in our friend group: we'd leave school and come right back, virtually.

In the first week of the May–June 2019 Intersession, we held interviews with students and staff, and quickly realized this could be something bigger.

There were a few things on our minds:

- Being able to identify players as students, and know who's who
- Making sure *only* d.tech community members could access the server
- Safety vs. self-expression: where do we draw the line on interactions?

Laptops in hand, half the team set out walking into different rooms to build them to-scale, while the other half of us devised implementations for the community. This latter task would take us quite some time and iteration to get right.

We knew we wouldn't be able to do a full launch, so our goal for these two weeks was to complete a first build of at least the school itself.

In the months that followed, the team worked on:

- Building out the surrounding area, such as Oracle's Redwood Shores campus
- Storyboarding and building custom minigames and gamemodes
- Preparing for a school-wide launch

We were ready.

## Launch

The timing is rather poetic: we launched d.craft exactly a week before our school would close its doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

We presented our announcement trailer at our weekly community meeting. I will never forget the sense of awe and pride from everyone in the room to be a d.tech student. I'm pretty sure I teared up after the standing ovation. :)

## Lessons

1. Respect momentum (don't kill free hype)
2. Set a ship date (don't launch before you're ready)
3. Don't announce things without a date
