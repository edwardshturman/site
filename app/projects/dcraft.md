# d.craft

To those unfamiliar — certainly to the parents of players — d.craft may seem like just a Minecraft server. But in the midst of a pandemic, it was an extension of the community at Design Tech High School. A place where students could be themselves and make friends, at a time when both were very difficult. In its time, d.craft became imbued in our school's culture. It was my first foray into bringing both teams and communities together. And by the end of it, I realized, this is what I wanted to do: ship projects people love, and bring people together around them.

Here's the story of how we brought d.craft to life — a virtual recreation of the Design Tech High School campus in Minecraft.

## Spark

### Design Tech High School

I'm very fortunate to have fond memories from my time at [Design Tech High School](https://designtechhighschool.org) ("d.tech" for short). I can only describe d.tech as if it were the brainchild of the [Stanford d.school](https://dschool.stanford.edu) (Hasso Plattner Institute of Design), [IDEO](https://ideo.com), and modern startups.

Well, that's sort of exactly what it is: our founders worked directly with them to figure out what education should look like. The curriculum put heavy emphasis on design thinking and other soft skills that are becoming more and more tangible today. There is a palpable air of experimentation, prototyping, and self-direction. Put simply, if you're anything like me, it is a *dream* of a high school. I loved it very much.

Until January 2018, we occupied a warehouse in Millbrae we lovingly called the "Hangar" (fittingly, it looked like an airplane hangar). "Classrooms" were really sections of the large space separated by makeshift walls made out of wood we cut out. We then moved into Oracle's campus in Redwood Shores, where d.tech now stands.

### Intersession

Four times a school year, we'd have Intersession: a two-week break from regular classes to deep dive into guest-led workshops (e.g. productivity & happiness), skills (e.g. Korean martial arts), or self-directed projects.

From May 2019, my incredibly talented friend <Author name="Joss Ettrick" avatar="/avatars/joss.jpg" link="https://jossettrick.com" /> and I would lead Intersession cohorts with our friends and build the school, block by block (pun intended). I took care of server administration — managing plugins, permissions, etc. — as well as branding, marketing, and communicating with the school. Joss was our chief builder.
