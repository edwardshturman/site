# d.craft

To those unfamiliar — certainly to the parents of players — d.craft may seem like just a Minecraft server. But in the midst of a pandemic, it was an extension of the community at Design Tech High School. A place where students could be themselves and make friends, at a time when both were very difficult. In its time, d.craft became imbued in our school's culture. It was my first foray into bringing both teams and communities together. And by the end of it, I realized, this is what I wanted to do: ship projects people love, and bring people together around them.

Here's the story of how we brought d.craft to life — a virtual recreation of the Design Tech High School campus in Minecraft.
