# compsigh

Computer Science is the fastest-growing major at the University of San Francisco. And yet, we are a small but mighty 400. When I joined USF as a freshman in 2021, to my surprise, **there was no general CS club on campus**. In fact, there was virtually no culture around doing *anything* social — let alone learning & shipping together.

As a web dev, I wanted to go beyond the largely systems- and theory-based curriculum. I wanted it to be social. I wanted to meet cool people, and I wanted to build cool things.

**I wanted to make CS fun again.**

Today, compsigh is comprised of **over 50% of the major**. Leading a leadership team of six, we've ideated and executed on **56 events to date**. From socials, to workshops, to hackathons — we've completely transformed the culture within and around the Computer Science major at USF.

I'm working on a place where you can learn about all of these in depth. In the meantime, here are my favorite highlights:

- Check out [DEPLOY/23](/projects/deploy23), our flagship annual hackathon from last Fall
- Check out [Cue](/projects/cue), a compsigh team project that won Best App at a different hackathon hosted at USF
- Check out [U Can UI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLlz6CMZDoo), a distilled version of a compsigh workshop I led on why programmers should learn design
