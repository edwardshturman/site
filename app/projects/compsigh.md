# compsigh

"Meet cool people, build cool things." Here's the story of compsigh, the computer science club I founded at the University of San Francisco.

## The default path

The default modus operandi for computer science students today is this:

1. Think — or be pressured into thinking (often by parents) — a job in tech is lucrative; therefore, it's a career worth pursuing.
2. Crack the coding interview and get the degree.
3. Get a job working in big tech.
4. Cash out in 20 years.
5. Never code again.

This is doable, but I have a couple gripes with the default path.

Firstly, software engineering requires an insane level of dedication & craft. Assuming you don't actually care, you could brute-force your way through it, but that is — in my opinion — a miserable way to live.

Secondly, while it may have been true five years ago that a job in big tech meant greater job security, it's almost certainly no longer the case. *It's not "riskier" to go and do your own thing anymore.*

Of course, there's nothing wrong with working for a big tech company, even if financial gain is what you're after. The problem is when you don't have any real interest in your field, which, sadly, is the case for a nontrivial amount of students on the default path.

I wanted to take an alternate path. One in which I take ownership as a problem solver, as an engineer. One in which I could meet cool people, and build cool things.

## The alternate path

Computer science is the fastest-growing major at the University of San Francisco. It was to my surprise, then, that when I joined USF in 2021, *there was no general CS club on campus*. Despite the friendly, small department where you can get to know some really great people — not least of which our professors — there was no culture around learning & building together, or doing anything social.

As Matthew Stanciu of Purdue Hackers — an organization I deeply admire — poignantly notes in his essay, [Galactic Empire](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/galactic-empire), the majority of collegiate computer science orgs are structured for the default path.

compsigh is for people looking to take the alternate path.

## A club for the rest of us

There are two things that capture the essence of compsigh:

1. A chill Discord server, where members are encouraged to express themselves (the `#general` channel is a bit unhinged), share interesting artifacts from across the Internet, and hype up each other's work.
2. High-quality, low-stakes, in-person events. This is where friends & memories are made. Our regular gatherings include:

- Weekly socials ("compsigh nights");
- Workshops that anyone can host ("staging");
- Monthly off-campus outings ("touch grass");
- Discussions on current events in tech ("technically speaking"); and
- [Our flagship annual hackathon](/projects/deploy23) during the Fall semester ("DEPLOY").

I don't care much for numbers. We have over 50% of the CS students at USF in our Discord, but not all show up to events. That's ok. I care much more that I've met some of my best friends here, have shipped some of my most meaningful work because of it, and that others can say the same.
