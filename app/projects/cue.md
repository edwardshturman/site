## Inspiration

Cue was born at Dons Hack 2023 — a hackathon hosted by our friends at the Association for Computing Machinery × Women in Tech at the University of San Francisco.

The timing for an AI-powered study app was just right:

- It was March–April 2023, and [OpenAI had just announced GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4)
- That semester, I was taking European history, a note-heavy course
- The theme for the hackathon was ed-tech: build a solution that solves a problem in education

So, what's our problem we're solving? After all, there are plenty of flashcard apps out there. The thing is, they assume you already know what to study. My friend & teammate Sanjana and I thought to leverage what we know about active recall — one of the most efficient, science-backed study methods — to create a tool that **helps students ask the right questions**.
