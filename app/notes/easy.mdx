# "It's easy"

I don't like this phrase.

In my experience,

- Working out & self-improvement is hard
- Becoming a good design-engineer is hard
- Learning Mandarin is hard

If these things were easy, everyone would be doing them.

For me at least, the *struggle* of the task is part of the reward of seeing it through. *It's hard, but I'm doing it anyway.*

Telling someone "it's easy" is doing them a disservice: it devalues the work they put in, and makes them feel like shit if and when they encounter obstacles.
