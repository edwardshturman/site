# How I write

- I write how I speak. Most people read with *that voice* in their head. So it makes sense to write as if they're *listening* to my words — because in a way they are.
- It's cliché, but I get everything out of my head first, and polish later. As they say, "the first draft will always be crap."
- I believe the format of my writing matters as much as its content. I like to think I design as I write. I present my writing very intentionally. What I've noticed contributes to a pleasant reading experience:
  - Line height
  - Paragraph width
  - Lists and other non-paragraph elements

For related resources that have resonated with me, I've collected some [artifacts on writing](/artifacts?tags=writing).
