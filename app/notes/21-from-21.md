# 21 from 21

Lessons I've learned from being 21

*December 2024*

1. Avoid "situationships" in love and in life — they're an excuse to not commit
2. You will likely be happier either fully committing or not at all
3. Opportunity costs are real
4. Sometimes, we have to make our own mistakes
5. Do nice things for people, without expecting anything in return
6. Cultivate self-love; be your number one advocate
7. Self-acceptance is not self-love; have the humility to acknowledge your areas of improvement and act on them
8. Most inhibition is inauthentic
9. Keep a list of nice things your friends say about you
10. Tell your friends when you don't like what they say about you
11. Make a friend 1–3 years older than you who's on the same path
12. Make a friend 1–3 years younger than you who's on the same path
13. It's more peaceful to limit the things you try to exert control over
14. The scales will balance themselves
15. You can just make stuff
16. Identity follows action; we become what we do
17. Beware of execution gaps disguising themselves as knowledge gaps
18. Put in the work and good things will happen
19. Be a fan of other people's work
20. "Good enough" solutions = unsolved problems
21. The problems are what matter
