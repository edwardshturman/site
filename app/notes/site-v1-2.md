# Site `v1.2`: Video

After I wrote the [project page for my site](/projects/site), I started writing these devlogs for myself as a personal record, as well as to showcase things that were fun to build. I aim to publish one after an update that I feel is noteworthy enough. This is one of those. :)

This update is a huge performance/quality of life boost, including:

- [Support for video](#video)
- [A fix to layout shift](#layout-shift)
- [Lower image load times](#load-times)

## Video

## Load times

## Layout shift

That's it for this one! [Follow me on X](https://x.com/edwardshturman) for fun design experiments, and real-time thoughts as I build and write about these updates.
