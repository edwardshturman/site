# Mandarin learning log

**2024-02-29**

I figured it'd be nice to familiarize myself with Pinyin/tones. I've studied a few languages, but Mandarin is my first where the intonation can change the meaning of the word. Today I covered:

- Flat tone e.g. mā
- Rising tone e.g. má

Today, I practiced conversing with a Mandarin-speaking friend in class. It was fun and I thought it'd be a good place to start this. For context, I've been studying for a week or so and currently understand:

- Basic introduction: 你好，我叫/叫我/我名字叫 Edward
- Asking for one's name: 你什么名字？
- Surnames: 我姓 Shturman
