# Mandarin learning log

I started learning Mandarin in February 2024 because:

1. It's useful. I live in San Francisco (although most here are Cantonese speakers), but even that aside, there are about a billion Mandarin speakers.
2. My family's Ukrainian, and I grew up speaking Russian. Knowing multiple languages as it is gives me a strong advantage for learning another one.
3. I like connecting with people. In my case, it brings a warm feeling when a friend or someone I meet speaks Russian or Ukrainian.
4. It makes learning other Asian languages like Japanese and Korean easier.
5. Learning languages is fun for me. A good challenge. :)

Note: there might be some inaccuracies as I work on my Pinyin and recognizing characters. Please correct me if you notice anything off. :)

I figured it'd be nice to familiarize myself with Pinyin/tones. I've studied a few languages, but Mandarin is my first where the intonation can change the meaning of the word. Today I covered:

- Flat tone e.g. mā
- Rising tone e.g. má

Today, I practiced conversing with a Mandarin-speaking friend. It was fun and I thought it'd be a good place to start this. For context, I've been studying for a week or so and currently understand:

- Basic introduction: 你好，我叫/叫我/我名字叫 Edward
- Asking for one's name: 你什么名字？
- Surnames: 我姓 Shturman
